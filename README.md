## 👥 User Roles & Permissions

DocChain implements a **role-based access control (RBAC)** system with clear **separation of duties** for security and accountability.

### Role Overview

| Role        | View TORs | Request TOR | Create/Edit TOR | Manage Users | Verify Blockchain | View Transactions | Archive Records |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Guest**   | ❌        | ❌          | ❌              | ❌           | ✅                | ✅                | ❌              |
| **Student** | Own only  | ✅          | ❌              | ❌           | ✅                | ✅                | ❌              |
| **Registrar**| All students | ❌       | ✅ (Edit only)  | ❌           | ✅                | ✅                | ✅              |
| **Admin**   | ✅ All    | ❌          | ❌ (View only)  | ✅           | ✅                | ✅                | ✅              |

### Detailed Role Permissions

#### 🔓 Guest
**Purpose:** Public document verification and transparency

**Can:**
- ✅ Verify TOR authenticity using blockchain hash lookup
- ✅ View all blockchain transactions (public ledger transparency)
- ✅ Search for specific TOR by hash or document ID
- ✅ See verification status without revealing personal data

**Cannot:**
- ❌ Access any TOR content or personal student data
- ❌ Download TOR documents
- ❌ Create accounts or access system features

**Use Cases:**
- 🏢 Employers verifying graduate credentials before hiring
- 🏫 Universities checking transfer student transcripts
- 🏛️ Government agencies confirming academic qualifications
- 🌍 International institutions validating documents for immigration/study abroad

**Privacy Protection:** Only the hash is visible — no names, grades, or personal information.

---

#### 🎓 Student
**Purpose:** Access personal academic records

**Can:**
- ✅ **Everything a Guest can do** (verify blockchain, view transactions)
- ✅ **PLUS:** View and download their own TOR
- ✅ Request TOR generation or updates from Registrar
- ✅ Download verified TOR documents with embedded QR code

**Cannot:**
- ❌ View other students' records
- ❌ Edit any TOR content
- ❌ Create accounts or manage users

**Key Difference from Guest:**
- Guest can verify ANY TOR exists and is legitimate
- Student can verify AND access/download their OWN TOR content

---

#### 📝 Registrar
**Purpose:** Manage and update academic records

**Can:**
- ✅ **Everything a Student can do** (verify blockchain, view transactions, access TORs)
- ✅ **PLUS:** View all student TORs in the system
- ✅ **Create and edit TOR content** (grades, subjects, enrollment data)
- ✅ Archive outdated or incorrect records
- ✅ **Request new user accounts** from Admin
- ✅ Verify blockchain records for quality assurance

**Cannot:**
- ❌ Create user accounts directly (must request from Admin for audit trail)
- ❌ Push records to blockchain (requires Admin approval for immutability)
- ❌ Request TORs for themselves

**Workflow:**
1. Registrar enters/updates student academic data
2. Reviews and marks TOR as "Ready for Blockchain"
3. Submits to Admin for blockchain finalization

**Why this separation?** Registrars are content experts who manage day-to-day academic records, but they shouldn't have final authority to permanently seal records on the blockchain.

---

#### ⚙️ Admin
**Purpose:** System management and blockchain finalization

**Can:**
- ✅ **Everything previous roles can do** (verify blockchain, view transactions)
- ✅ **PLUS:** View all TORs (read-only access to content)
- ✅ **Create new user accounts** (Student, Registrar, Admin roles)
- ✅ **Push approved TORs to blockchain** (permanent record creation)
- ✅ **Approve/reject account creation requests** from Registrars
- ✅ Archive records and manage system settings
- ✅ Verify all blockchain transactions

**Cannot:**
- ❌ Edit TOR content directly (Registrar responsibility — prevents conflict of interest)
- ❌ Request new accounts (Admin IS the approval authority)
- ❌ Request TORs for themselves

**Workflow:**
1. Admin reviews TORs marked "Ready for Blockchain" by Registrars
2. Verifies data accuracy and completeness
3. Pushes approved TORs to blockchain (creates immutable hash)
4. Handles account creation requests from Registrars

**Why this separation?** Admins are system guardians who provide oversight. They can't edit content (that's the Registrar's domain), but they're the only ones who can finalize records to permanent blockchain storage.

---

### 🔐 Security Design: Separation of Duties

**Why split Registrar and Admin roles?**

This architecture implements the **principle of least privilege** and **separation of duties**:

1. **Registrars = Content Experts**
   - Handle day-to-day academic record management
   - Subject matter expertise in student data
   - Can edit but cannot finalize to permanent storage

2. **Admins = System Guardians**
   - Provide oversight and quality control
   - Final authority for blockchain publishing
   - Cannot edit content (prevents conflict of interest)
   - Control system access and user management

3. **Checks and Balances**
   - No single person can both create AND permanently publish records
   - Account creation requires approval (creates audit trail)
   - Blockchain finalization requires separate authority from content creation
   - Prevents unauthorized data manipulation

**Real-world analogy:**
- **Registrar** = Editor at newspaper (writes and edits content)
- **Admin** = Publisher (decides what gets published permanently)
- Neither can do both = checks and balances

This separation ensures data integrity, accountability, and prevents unauthorized modifications to permanent blockchain records.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Protection Strategy
- ✅ **No personal data stored on blockchain** – Only verification hashes (Keccak-256)
- ✅ **Role-based access control** – Users see only authorized data
- ✅ **Secure authentication** – Multi-factor with email verification
- ✅ **Input validation** – All forms validated with Zod schemas before processing
- ✅ **SQL injection prevention** – Using Drizzle ORM parameterized queries
- ✅ **XSS protection** – React's built-in escaping + Content Security Policy
- ✅ **Public verification** – Anyone can verify without compromising privacy

### Blockchain Privacy Model
```
TOR Document (Personal Data)
        ↓
    Hash with Keccak-256
        ↓
    Store hash on blockchain (public, immutable)
        ↓
    Keep actual document in secure database (private, access-controlled)
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Document authenticity is publicly verifiable
- ✅ Personal information remains private
- ✅ Tampering is impossible (blockchain immutability)
- ✅ Compliant with data privacy regulations

## 🐛 Known Issues & Improvements

### Current Status: Production-Ready with Minor Enhancements Planned

#### ✅ What Works Perfectly
- ✅ Core CRUD functionality for all document types
- ✅ Blockchain verification and hash generation
- ✅ Role-based access control across all routes
- ✅ PDF generation and download with embedded QR codes
- ✅ User authentication and session management
- ✅ Database operations and complex queries
- ✅ File upload handling (successfully processes files up to 50MB+)
- ✅ Public verification system for guests
- ✅ Email notifications and automated workflows

#### 🚧 Active Improvements (Post-Client Feedback)

**Loading State Optimization (In Progress)**
- **Issue:** During large file uploads, loading indicators don't update smoothly, potentially making users think the app has frozen
- **Reality:** Files upload and save successfully — this is a UI communication issue, not a functional problem
- **Root Cause:** React state updates during long async operations need optimization
- **Solution in Progress:** Implementing improved state management using React transitions, toast notifications, and real-time progress indicators
- **ETA:** Completion by [your target date]

**Planned Enhancements:**
- [ ] Real-time upload progress tracking (0-100% indicator)
- [ ] Multi-stage loading states (uploading → processing → complete)
- [ ] Background job processing for very large files
- [ ] Enhanced error handling with retry mechanisms
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard for Admins

### Lessons Learned
- **Functionality isn't enough** – Users need clear feedback during all operations
- **Production-ready means user-friendly** – Not just technically correct
- **Early user testing is critical** – Identifies UX issues before deployment
- **State management patterns matter** – Especially for async operations in React
- **Separation of duties prevents issues** – Security and accountability through role design
